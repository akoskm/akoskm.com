Form actions in Remix are handled by the `action` function that runs on your server. They work very much like loaders, except they're called when you make a `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `POST`, or `PUT` to your route.

Remix's action/loader structure is incredibly straightforward and easy to grasp! If you've got some experience with data flow in client-server applications, you'll find this a piece of cake. But before we answer how we can handle multiple form actions in Remix, let's understand how the data flow works.

### The Remix Fullstack Data Flow

In the Remix Fullstack Data Flow, the `loader` fetches data from the backend and passes that data to your component. The `action` passes your component data to the backend. After the `action` finishes, loaders are revalidated and return the current state of the backend to the component.

This is how Remix keeps your backend and frontend data in sync without any additional code to do refetches.

Also, in Remix each route has one `loader` and one `action`.

The issue arises when, on the client, you want to handle different functionalities, and each functionality would require a different action on the backend.

Let's take a look at this simple Todo app:

```typescript
export async function loader() {
  return json({ todos: getTodos() });
}

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const { todo } = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());
  await addTodo(todo);
  return json({ ok: true });
}

export default function Index() {
  const { todos } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  const actionData = useActionData<typeof action>();

  return (
    <div className="max-w-md">
      <h1 className="text-2xl pb-10">Todos</h1>
      <Form method="post" className="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <label htmlFor="todo">Title</label>
        <input type="text" name="todo" id="todo" autoComplete="off" />
        <button>Add</button>
      </Form>
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id} className="text-lg pt-5">
            ✔️ {todo.text}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

There is nothing fancy here, just an input and a button to submit a todo item to your list.

## The problem with multiple actions

Let's say we want to extend the functionality with a button to remove all items with a single click:

```typescript
<Form method="post" className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <label htmlFor="todo">Title</label>
  <input type="text" name="todo" id="todo" autoComplete="off" />
  <button>Add</button>
  <button>Clear</button>
</Form>
```

But because we have only one `action` handler, it doesn't matter which of these buttons we click, the action result is the same:

## The solution

To work around this, we'll add two new attributes to each of these buttons: `name` and `value`.

I like to use `name="intent"` (reminds me of Android's Intent) and a custom `value` describing the action we want to run:

```typescript
<Form method="post" className="flex flex-col gap-4">
  <label htmlFor="todo">Title</label>
  <input type="text" name="todo" id="todo" autoComplete="off" />
  <button name="intent" value="add">Add</button>
  <button name="intent" value="clear">Clear</button>
</Form>
```

Now, whenever we submit our form data, the request's `request.formData` will contain an additional field `formData.get("intent")`.

We can use this value to decide what to do next:

```typescript
export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const { todo } = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());
  const intent = formData.get("intent");
  switch (intent) {
    case "add": await addTodo(todo); break;
    case "clear": clearTodos(); break;
    default: throw new Error("Unexpected action");
  }
  return json({ ok: true });
}
```

And finally, here's how the UI works after taking into consideration the value of `intent`:
