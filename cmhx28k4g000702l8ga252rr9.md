In this blog post, you’ll learn how to try OpenAI Codex right now with just a $5 one-time top-up on your existing ChatGPT account — no $20/month ChatGPT Plus needed. I’ll walk you through the exact VSCode setup, show a real-world production feature I built for $0.77, and demonstrate how it works in a live app.

I’ve been a happy Cursor user for a couple of months now. I love their recent updates, and everything is evolving in a direction that helps me get more done with AI-assisted coding.

But people are constantly sharing their amazing experiences with Codex and Claude Code, the two recent competitors in the AI coding world.

The problem?

Until now, I haven't found a way to try any of these tools without subscribing to their monthly plan. Yes, you get a lot for $20, but I already have all those capabilities through Grok.

Then just yesterday, I thought, let’s install the Codex plugin in VSCode and see what I can do with it without the subscription. When I opened the Extension, it offered me to enter my API key or sign in with my ChatGPT account.

Since I’ve built some apps on top of OpenAI’s API, I knew I could top up my account with only $5, give the key to the extension, and give it a shot.

So I topped up $5, grabbed my API key, and opened VSCode.

Two chat rounds later: feature shipped.

Dashboard: $0.77 spent, 2.73M tokens, one clean spike.

If you are unsure whether to go with Codex or not, I suggest you do the same experiment.

## Why spend $5 to try Codex

* **No recurring fee**: One-time $5 → full API access (can’t send tasks to Cloud, but I don’t know what that is yet)
    
* **Models**: GPT-5, GPT-5-Codex
    
* **VSCode native**: Official OpenAI extension → chat, file-aware, reads your codebase.
    
* **Perfect for testing**: Try before you buy Plus, Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.
    

## Step-by-Step: Try Codex in 5 Minutes

1. Go straight to [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) and log in with your ChatGPT account.
    
2. Create a separate project for this so it doesn’t interfere with other spending.

3. In the sidebar, select Billing, which is where you can top up your balance

4. Now go to [https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and generate a key
    
5. **Install OpenAI VSCode extension** Marketplace → search **"Codex"** (publisher: OpenAI) → install.
    
6. **Sign in** Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) → codex → *Open* *Codex Sidebar* → paste key.
    
7. **Start coding**

**You’re live**. No Plus. No proxy. Full Codex in your editor.

## Real Production Test: Dropdown → Cleanup Job

Task I wanted to get done in a live app:

* Add dropdown: "Archive old analytics"
    
* POST /api/archive-old → delete rows &gt;90 days old
    
* Return { deleted: count }
    
* Show toast
    
* Add an integration test
    

**Prompt** (copy-paste):

> As Superuser, I want to have the ability to exclude Analytics from billing. The exclude from study button should be placed inside the dropdown where we also have Archive and Delete Analytics.
> 
> Create the necessary endpoint for this that marks the appropriate analyticsItems as excludedFromBilling.

### Round 1:

* **Backend**: Perfect. Naming, types, SQL, error handling.
    
* **Integration test**: Auto-detected bun test. **I didn’t specify the framework** — it read the repo.
    
* **Frontend**: Missing entirely.
    

I asked:

> hmm, do you know what is missing based on the spec I gave you?

Codex:

> Right now only the backend half is done… &lt;long explanation of what it did&gt; …Want me to take care of the frontend piece next?

### Round 2 (Frontend):

* **Perfect**: Correct component, translation key, toast, loading state.
    
* Followed exact patterns from SettingsMenu.tsx.
    

## Summary

**Total**: 2 rounds, shipped, deployed. **Cost**: **$0.77** (2,734,569 tokens).

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| November spend | **$0.77** / $20 |
| Total tokens | 2,734,569 |
| Spike pattern | One clean peak |

## Conclusion

**You don’t need ChatGPT Plus to try Codex**. A **$5 top-up + VSCode extension** gives you **full AI coding power** — in your real codebase, with your patterns, for pennies.

Is this sustainable?

Of course not, since I’d be likely shipping 5 features for $5, where my $20/mo Cursor subscription can last all month while shipping daily.

But if this saved you $20, share it with others and tag me [@akoskm on 𝕏](https://x.com/akoskm).
