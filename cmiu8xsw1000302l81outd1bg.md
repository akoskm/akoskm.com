You're running browser tests in your Next.js app with Vitest, and suddenly you're hit with a cascade of Vite pre-transform errors. This time for me it was a next-auth import type error and I couldn't figure out why, since I was importing the types only.

The error message pointed to a seemingly innocent import statement, but the tests kept failing. If you're using `next-auth` with TypeScript, there's a good chance you've encountered this exact problem.

The issue comes from a subtle but critical difference in how TypeScript handles type imports, and how bundlers like Vite interpret them.

## The next-auth import type error

When running browser tests with Vitest, you might see errors like this next-auth import type error:

```bash
[vite] (client) Pre-transform error: No known conditions for "./adapters" specifier in "next-auth" package
  Plugin: vite:import-analysis
  File: /path/to/src/server/db/schema.ts:25:36
  20 |  import {} from "next-auth/adapters";
     |                  ^
```

The error repeats multiple times, and while your tests might still pass, these warnings clutter your output and indicate a deeper bundling issue.

## The Culprit

The problem is in how you're importing types from `next-auth/adapters`. You might have written:

```typescript
import { type AdapterAccount } from "next-auth/adapters";
```

This looks correct at first glance. You're using the `type` keyword, so TypeScript knows it's a type import.

However, this syntax has a different meaning to bundlers like Vite.

## The Solution

Change your import to use the `import type` syntax instead:

```typescript
import type { AdapterAccount } from "next-auth/adapters";
```

This single change eliminates the Vite pre-transform errors and ensures your bundler handles the import correctly.

## Understanding the Difference

There are two ways to import types in TypeScript, and they behave differently.

### `import type { ... }` - Type-Only Import

```typescript
import type { AdapterAccount } from "next-auth/adapters";
```

This is a **type-only import statement**. The entire import is marked as type-only, which means:

- TypeScript removes it completely at compile time
- The module isn't evaluated or analyzed by the bundler
- Vite can skip analyzing the module entirely during pre-transform
- No runtime code is generated

### `import { type ... }` - Value Import with Type-Only Named Import

```typescript
import { type AdapterAccount } from "next-auth/adapters";
```

This is a **value import statement** with a type-only named import. Even though the specific import is marked as type-only:

- The import statement itself is still a value import
- The bundler may still analyze the module
- Vite attempts to resolve the module during pre-transform
- This can cause issues with packages like `next-auth` that have complex export conditions

## Why This Matters for Vite and Bundlers

Modern bundlers like Vite perform static analysis on your code before transformation. When they encounter an import statement, they need to understand:

- Is this a type import that can be ignored?
- Does this module need to be bundled?
- What are the export conditions for this package?

With `import { type ... }`, the bundler sees a value import and may attempt to analyze the module, even if the specific named export is type-only.

For packages like `next-auth` that use conditional exports (like `"./adapters"`), this analysis can fail when the bundler can't determine the correct export condition for the build target.

## Best Practices

When importing types in TypeScript, especially in projects using Vite, Webpack, or other modern bundlers:

- **Prefer `import type` for type-only imports** - Use `import type { ... }` when you're only importing types
- **Use `import { type ... }` sparingly** - Only use this syntax when mixing type and value imports from the same module
- **Be consistent** - Choose one pattern and stick with it across your codebase

### ESlint

Looks like there's an ESlint rule `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-exports` that can help you catch these import statements. Check out [Consistent Type Imports and Exports: Why and How](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/consistent-type-imports-and-exports-why-and-how/#enforcing-with-typescript-eslint).

## Conclusion

The difference between `import type { ... }` and `import { type ... }` might seem minor, but it has real implications for how bundlers process your code.

When working with Next.js, React, and packages like `next-auth`, using the correct type import syntax prevents bundler errors and keeps your test output clean.

If you're seeing Vite pre-transform errors related to type imports, check your import statements and convert them to use `import type` syntax. Your bundler—and your future self—will thank you while you avoid the next-auth import type error altogether.

For deeper dives, see the official docs for the [NextAuth adapter API](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#adapter), the TypeScript [`import type`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html#type-only-imports-and-export) syntax, and Vite's guidance on [conditional exports](https://vitejs.dev/guide/dep-pre-bundling.html#conditional-exports).

**Next Steps:** Review your codebase for type imports and standardize on `import type` syntax. This small change will improve your build performance and eliminate unnecessary bundler warnings.
