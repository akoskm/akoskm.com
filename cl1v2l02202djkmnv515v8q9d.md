## Stop Doing Coding Tutorials

⚠️ *Disclaimer I don’t want to gatekeep and tell you what tutorials are worth reading. In fact, I welcome all and every kind of tutorial, keep writing them!*

*This post is for those who are reading them and feel they’re not progressing.* ⚠️

About a year ago I learned about the idea of tutorial purgatory or tutorial hell. I'm confident, I can set you on the right course to escape it.

Completing tutorials feels good. They're a lot shorter than a book, ideal for a daily dose of dopamine.

They're mostly free, further encouraging you to grab them, and it can be hard to stop because there’s the reward when you complete them!

### Why there are so many tutorials?

Tutorials exist for different reasons. Some people write tutorials for a living. They write one every single day. Is it the 20th "Getting started with X", "Learning Y in 10 minutes", or the 100th spin on "Why you should be using Z right now"?

Some people write tutorials only to practice writing.

*You don't have to read all the tutorials out there on trivial topics like how to use `Array.map`, that's ridiculous.*

I’m not talking here about tutorials discussing how to integrate different tech or platforms that sometimes indeed need a tutorial because the official docs simply can’t explain the integration with every possible tech out there.

### What to do instead?

You can create plenty by following the official documentation. 

Most of the libraries you want to work with already have a simple "Getting Started" page:

React 👉 [https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

Others are packed with examples, comprehensive documentation, screencasts, free courses:

TailwindCSS 👉 [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)

These are free resources. They're up to date, coming from the developers of the library itself. Packed not only with examples but best practices and patterns you should follow.

### Conclusion

As a beginner, these pages should be your bread & butter.

The next step is basically just using this tech to build something.

I believe this is just as important as reading up on tech as not even more important. 

*Remember always build something with the tech you just learned, otherwise, it’ll be just another completed tutorial on your pile of completed tutorials.*
