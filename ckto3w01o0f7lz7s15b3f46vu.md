## From "Why start a Newsletter" to "Why I haven't started a Newsletter yet"

I wrote the first issue of my newsletter back in July 2021 but newer sent it out.

The issue consisted of Tweets & articles I've come across last week and found extremely helpful.

Because I usually share such articles on Twitter as well, I was thinking: resharing those in a form of a newsletter would be just repeated content aka. spam.

Recently I gained some new perspective on this from my friend Mike:

Newsletters are a searchable, organized, and longer-lasting way to share content on a specific topic.

I can compile a Twitter thread on: time tracking tools, time management systems, and how you can apply all this while working remotely - that tweet would disappear in 48 hours.

I want my newsletter to be an everlasting archive of organized knowledge.

I'll be sending out the first issue of my newsletter this Friday, and you're more than welcome to subscribe:

ps: I'm not adding the email addresses of my subscribers from akoskm.com, but I won't be sending out the same updates here and on my newsletter.
