Utility functions are part of every project.

You might organize them in folders called helper, lib, or shared, but their function is the same:

They make sure your business logic stays consistent in your game.

(Drop a like if you love the rhyme. ðŸ¤«ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¥)

We've spent the past few months moving around and converting JavaScript to TypeScript files, including such helpers, in a GitHub repo with around 40k+ files tracked in Git (so this size is without node\_modules or any generated files). We do this because the TypeScript check runs for ages on a project of this size, so we're introducing TypeScript Project References and splitting the app into smaller parts to speed up the checks. But this is a topic for another blog post.

Some of these files turned into TypeScript were the so-called "helpers". These functions encapsulate some business logic you want to be consistent in your entire app.

We did and reviewed a bunch of such conversions and noticed a pattern.

TypeScript developers love `as`.

![](https://i.imgflip.com/8bd6ve.jpg align="center")

Writing `as` is telling the compiler: *trust me bro I've got this*.

Let's look at a utility function from a blog engine. You have different collaborators and need to know if a collaborator is external. For completeness, the collaborator type is a user input that can be any of the values listed or an arbitrary string.

```javascript
// isCollaboratorExternal.js

export const COLLABORATOR_TYPES = {
  "EDITOR": "External Editor",
  "ADMINISTRATOR": "External Administrator",
  "GUEST": "Guest",
  "OTHER_COLLABORATOR": "Other Collaborator"
};

const externalCollaboratorTypes = [
  COLLABORATOR_TYPES.EDITOR,
  COLLABORATOR_TYPES.ADMINISTRATOR,
];

export function isCollaboratorExternal(collaboratorType) {
  return externalCollaboratorTypes.includes(collaboratorType);
}
```

Now, let's say somewhere in your code, you call this function:

```typescript
// admin-panel.tsx

const { data } = useQuery<{ collaborator: { type: string } }>();

isCollaboratorExternal(data.collaborator.type);
```

How would you convert the `isCollaboratorExternal` function to TypeScript, so it plays nicely with the rest of the app?

The type of `data.collaborator.type` is of `string`, so it would make sense to make the following conversion:

```typescript
// isCollaboratorExternal.ts

export function isCollaboratorExternal(collaboratorType: string):boolean {
  return externalCollaboratorTypes.includes(collaboratorType);
}
```

But, uh oh, TypeScript isn't happy about this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704461096912/66cca88f-4785-4819-80fa-3f79e2125c71.png align="center")

The reason for `Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type '"External Editor" | "External Administrator"'.` is the fact that `externalCollaboratorTypes` only contains `"External Editor"` and `"External Administrator"` and it's not just an arbitrary string.

So why not type the argument as something that is one of the `externalCollaboratorTypes`:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704461043949/1af30f9c-4f27-424f-aead-6a2bd2a97cf9.png align="center")

The function definition now looks good, but when you call it with a response from our backend, TypeScript knows you might get an arbitrary string that's not `"External Editor"` or `"External Administrator"`.

Usually, this is when `as` happens:

```typescript
// isCollaboratorExternal.ts

export function isCollaboratorExternal(collaboratorType: string): boolean {
  return externalCollaboratorTypes.includes(collaboratorType as any);
}
```

Of course, this is one way to deal with the problem, but it's not a fair TypeScript conversion if you turn off type-checking.

But what else could you do?

The `collaboratorType` has to remain an arbitrary string because this helper operates on random input from users.

If you tell the compiler that the list `externalCollaboratorTypes` is a list of strings - which it is - you can leave the `collaboratorType: string` for the helper input - which is also realistic - and TypeScript will love this solution:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1704462116982/ce19e36e-6c74-46f6-b382-656c20b8f380.png align="center")

Now, you can pass in the arbitrary string as the `collaboratorType` and TypeScript will check if it's of the values in the `externalCollaboratorTypes` array.
