Authentication is no joke. When I first encountered the magic-link sign-in platforms, they blew me away with their simplicity and convenience.

Let me explain.

Most of you are already signed in to your email clients. Your email is probably tied to your bank account, GitHub, and hundreds of other services, so you keep it super secure. You probably have a `johndoe` user registered somewhere with the password `helloworld`, but I bet it's not your email account.

So your mailbox is secure by default, accessible, and uniquely identifies you.

Login forms already require an email. Most even use an email + password combination for authentication, so in theory, you always have the user's email.

Maybe we don't need anything more?

Enter **magic-links**!

*Supabase makes it super easy to implement magic links, but the fun doesn't end here. Check out my book to learn through practice how you build a Supabase-backed PWA, from scratch:* [https://a.co/d/dWzDolV](https://a.co/d/dWzDolV)

It allows users to log in by clicking a unique link sent to their email, eliminating the need for passwords. The unique link is like a temporary password. When clicked, the backend verifies the link's authenticity and generates a user session, and voila, you're logged in.

I hope you're excited to build such a system yourself. I almost feel bad for talking so long about the awesomeness of the **magic-link** idea.

It's time to get our hands dirty!

# Tech Stack and Requirements

For this project, we'll use Next.js, Supabase, and SendGrid. To make SendGrid sending effective, you'll need an email address to verify it as a Single Sender, but don't worry—I'll walk you through that step-by-step!

Every tool and tier we use in the project is free, and with this guide, you can get into production for $0 in just a few minutes. If you have questions, comment or contact me directly at [support@akoskm.com](mailto:support@akoskm.com).

# Setup

## Next.js

Our framework of choice for this project, but note that the general approach of implementing magic-link sign-ins would be the same for Remix, but your actions and SSR components would have a bit different syntax.

If you're also interested in a Remix version, comment, and I'll create one!

If you want to check out the basics of Remix, I have another post that might interest you:

%[https://akoskm.com/how-to-handle-multiple-form-actions-in-remix] 

To create a Next.js project from scratch, run this in your terminal:

```bash
$ npx create-next-app@latest magic-link-demo
```

Leave everything at the default setting:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717096251457/fae941d2-c1eb-49a8-ba26-a02e026bf614.png align="center")

Once this is done, switch to the generated directory `cd magic-link-demo` and if you're using VSCode, you can reopen the fresh project inside the current editor with this command `code . -r`.

Go ahead and create an `.env` file because in the next step we'll already put some values in there.

## Supabase

Supabase is a Firebase alternative. It provides a set of APIs that let you access a PostgreSQL database, Auth functionalities, and more.

To get started, head over to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717096005325/a6e2bb27-ee65-4115-87e4-b17aaa48208c.png align="center")

Once your project is created, scroll down to the **Connecting to your new project** section:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717096486213/51b08e08-fec7-44e7-94b6-da581a094c9c.png align="center")

Then copy and paste these two values into your `.env` file:

```bash
# .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_project_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>
```

Next, in the sidebar, select Settings &gt; Configuration &gt; Authentication, then scroll down to **SMTP Settings** and turn on Enable Custom SMTP:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717096968545/3250bc77-17b5-43b8-90e9-c985ebb918ce.png align="center")

This is very important to configure because Supabase can send up to 3 emails per hour, which you'll quickly run out of if you're just testing a new application.

Let's go to Sendgrid and obtain our SMTP settings.

## Sendgrid

SendGrid is a transactional email service that's super easy to use. Head over to [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com).

### Setting up a Single Sender

Expand the sidebar, and under Settings, select Sender Authentication. Follow the steps to configure a Single Sender.

You'll use this sender later in Supabase as a **Sender email**.

### Setting up an API key

Also, in the sidebar, under **Settings,** select **API keys**, then Create API key:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717097496337/ffac52d1-10f0-41e2-89c4-116f88b795f4.png align="center")

Click **Create & View** and copy the generated key.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717097556633/8ad8f0f5-a1b9-4260-9e91-925199fa20a0.png align="center")

## Configuring SMTP in Supabase

Head back to Supabase and paste it under *SMTP Provider Settings* into the *Password* field. The *Username* will be **apikey,** and the Host should be set to **smtp.sendgrid.net**. Set the Port number to **587**.

[This page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/for-developers/sending-email/integrating-with-the-smtp-api) should contain the up-to-date documentation for using Sendgrid SMPT with your API key.

For the Sender details, use the same email you used to configure the Single Sender identity.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717098415321/e66e5502-170c-40f6-99e5-a57b75b7286f.png align="center")

Once configured, click Save.

### Updating the Auth confirmation path

One last thing you have to do in Supabase is to change the **Confirm signup** email template from `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` to `{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup` as described [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs?queryGroups=router&router=app).

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717098866454/ff82abdc-4450-4541-9549-a319f79c0f32.png align="center")

Do the same thing in the **Magic Link** tab, but this time, set **type** to `magiclink`:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717134988988/4079e7d7-dc14-4329-8096-7316027152cb.png align="center")

Let's return to our Next.js project and add a simple Sign-in screen.

## daisyUI

For the UI, we'll use [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/), so install it first:

```bash
npm i -D daisyui@latest
```

and also add the daisyUI plugin to your tailwind config file as described in the [docs](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/):

```typescript
module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
```

# Magic-link sign-in

## Page

Once this is done, create a new file in `app/login/page.tsx`:

```typescript
export default async function Login() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center p-24">
      <form className="flex flex-col gap-4 prose">
        <h1>Log in</h1>
        <label className="input input-bordered flex items-center gap-2">
          Email
          <input
            name="email"
            type="text"
            className="grow"
            placeholder="daisy@site.com"
          />
        </label>
        <button className="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  );
}
```

It's time to take our Next.js app for a spin, type in in your terminal:

```plaintext
npm run dev
```

and head over to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/login). You should see something like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717130390480/7d4aae5d-ef56-441f-8c1b-28098ba55fd1.png align="center")

## Action

Currently, the Submit button doesn't do anything, so let's implement the server action that will trigger Supabase's sing-in flow for us.

### Supabase Client util functions

First, you'll need a function to obtain the Supabase client in your server components. These functions aren't built into Supabase, but they are described in their official docs [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs?queryGroups=router&router=app).

Before creating the util function, make sure to install the core Supabase and the Supabase Server Side Rendering (in beta) packages:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr
```

And now, create the file `utils/supabase/server.ts`. This is taken from the [docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs?queryGroups=router&router=app), but I'll explain what it does below.

```typescript
import { createServerClient, type CookieOptions } from '@supabase/ssr'
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'

export function createClient() {
  const cookieStore = cookies()

  return createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        get(name: string) {
          return cookieStore.get(name)?.value
        },
        set(name: string, value: string, options: CookieOptions) {
          try {
            cookieStore.set({ name, value, ...options })
          } catch (error) {
            // The `set` method was called from a Server Component.
            // This can be ignored if you have middleware refreshing
            // user sessions.
          }
        },
        remove(name: string, options: CookieOptions) {
          try {
            cookieStore.set({ name, value: '', ...options })
          } catch (error) {
            // The `delete` method was called from a Server Component.
            // This can be ignored if you have middleware refreshing
            // user sessions.
          }
        },
      },
    }
  )
}
```

This util module defines a function `createClient` that initializes a Supabase client for server-side rendering in a Next.js application. It uses environment variables for the Supabase URL and anonymous key and manages cookies for authentication and session handling. The cookie operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks to handle potential errors when called from server components.

### Sign in Action

Inside this Server Action, we'll do three things:

1. obtain a Supabase client we just created
    
2. gather the form data and pass it to Supabase
    
3. if there's an error, log it and redirect to the root page. In production, you might want to redirect to a dedicated /error page
    

Create a file next to `page.tsx`, called `action.tsx`:

```typescript
"use server";

import { createClient } from "@/utils/supabase/server";
import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export async function signIn(formData: FormData) {
  const supabase = createClient();

  const data = {
    email: formData.get("email") as string,
    emailRedirectTo: "/",
  };

  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp(data);

  if (error) {
    console.error("Error logging in:", error.message);
  }

  revalidatePath("/", "layout");
  redirect("/");
}
```

## Connect Action to Page

Finally, call this action on the main `form` element of the login page:

```typescript
import { signIn } from "./action";

export default async function Login() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center p-24">
      <form action={signIn} className="flex flex-col gap-4 prose">
        ... no changes here
      </form>
    </main>
  )
};
```

I know it's tempting, but don't test the form submission yet! You would get the email, but the `/auth/confirm` route the link would redirect to doesn't exist, so let's create that!

## Confirmation Route

Let's create a route handler in `app/auth/confirm/route.ts`.

This processes a GET request to verify an email OTP (one-time password) from Supabase. It extracts the `token_hash`, `type`, and `next` parameters from the request URL. If both `token_hash` and `type` are present, it creates a Supabase client and attempts to verify the OTP.

If the verification is successful, it redirects the user to the `next` URL, removing the `token_hash` and `type` parameters. If the verification fails or the parameters are missing, it redirects the user to an error page.

```typescript
import { type EmailOtpType } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server'

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const token_hash = searchParams.get('token_hash')
  const type = searchParams.get('type') as EmailOtpType | null
  const next = searchParams.get('next') ?? '/'

  const redirectTo = request.nextUrl.clone()
  redirectTo.pathname = next
  redirectTo.searchParams.delete('token_hash')
  redirectTo.searchParams.delete('type')

  if (token_hash && type) {
    const supabase = createClient()

    const { error } = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({
      type,
      token_hash,
    })
    if (!error) {
      redirectTo.searchParams.delete('next')
      return NextResponse.redirect(redirectTo)
    }
  }

  // return the user to an error page with some instructions
  redirectTo.pathname = '/error'
  return NextResponse.redirect(redirectTo)
}
```

We're almost there!

Before we test this, let's just update the root page of our app and render something different when we're logged in!

# Authenticated Dashboard

Replace the contents of `app/page.tsx` with the following:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/utils/supabase/server";
import Link from "next/link";
import { signOut } from "./action";

export default async function Home() {
  const supabase = createClient();

  const { data } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  const isLoggedIn = !!data?.user;

  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Link href="/login">Log in</Link>;

  return (
    <main className="flex flex-col gap-5 items-center justify-between p-24">
      <div className="z-10 w-full max-w-5xl items-center justify-between font-mono text-sm lg:flex">
        Logged in as {data?.user?.email}
      </div>
      <form action={signOut} className="flex flex-col gap-4 prose">
        <button className="btn btn-primary">Log out</button>
      </form>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Above is a simple Server-Side Rendered page that does the following:

1. checks if the user logged in by simply requesting user from the supabase client
    
2. if not, returns a link to the `/login` page
    
3. if logged in, prints the email of the user and a **Log out** button
    

The **Log out** button will call this simple server action that you can put into `app/action.ts`:

```typescript
'use server';

import { createClient } from "@/utils/supabase/server";
import {redirect} from "next/navigation";

export async function signOut() {
  const supabase = createClient();

  await supabase.auth.signOut();
  redirect("/");
}
```

Don't forget `'use server'` directive at the top of the file! Otherwise, you'll be getting a message like this in your browser:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717134484175/5029c935-b12b-4d4f-9cef-80ed34cb9998.png align="center")

Now it's time to test the sign-in!

Open the login page, enter your email address, and click **Submit**.

⚠️ Note that if you've been testing too intensively, you might get the following error upon sign-in 😅:

```xml
Error logging in: Email rate limit exceeded
```

There is a certain rate limit even for services like SendGrid. Just wait a few minutes, grab tea and coffee, and try again. 😊

If you've been waiting patiently – or didn't exceed your limit – an email like this will be in your mailbox:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717133262119/9b4f7e21-30be-4361-b564-de18108cb5f4.png align="center")

Note that this is our first sign-in, so the email body says **Confirm your signup**. You'll see soon that it'll look different when we try to sign in for the second time.

Clicking the link or copy-pasting it into your browser should redirect you to the customized dashboard page:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717133403079/d4aece75-d387-424f-b08d-38589f075032.png align="center")

Hitting Log out should take you back to our very simple, unauthenticated page:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717134550949/2edc687f-ec33-4a53-a5b3-34d34b929bb1.png align="center")

And signing in again should send you an email that now looks like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1717134660280/ce3cd220-44b6-4982-9589-9a7576516127.png align="center")

But clicking the link should lead you to the authenticated page, just like after confirming your registration.

# Conclusion

Well done! 🎉

You just got yourself a fully functional app with magic-link sign-ins using Next.js, Supabase, and Sendgrid.

If you ask me, I don't think much more is needed here. You have the sign-in and sign-up through the same form and an authenticated and unauthenticated version of a dashboard. What else is needed?

Add a payment system integration and start collecting money for your unique service!

If you'd like to extend your app with some AI features, like taking Voice notes and turning them into blog posts, my recent book is a great way to start, and you're also supporting my work:
