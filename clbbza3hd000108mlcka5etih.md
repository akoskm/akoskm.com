# How to Connect Browser Extensions to Supabase

Today we'll learn how to use Supabase to add sign-up and sign-in to a browser extension.

We will reuse our existing cross-browser extension template:

This post will put the Cat Facts application behind a login screen while teaching you Supabase authentication basics.

But first things first, let's set up a new Supabase project.

Supabase has an excellent getting-started guide for React that you can follow [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-react#project-set-up).

We'll be doing the same things but in a bit different order.

# Set up a new Supabase project

After [logging into Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/), head to All Projects and click New Project.

Create a new project with the **Free - $0/month** plan.

Enter the project details and wait for it to be initialized.

After the initialization is done, on the project screen, find the section **Connecting to your new project** and copy the JavaScript snippet it provides:

# Set up the Supabase client

Now open the [vite-react-tailwindcss-browser-extension](https://github.com/akoskm/vite-react-tailwindcss-browser-extension) repo that you just cloned or have it from the previous tutorial and create a new file: `src/supabase_client.ts` where you paste what you just copied.

While in a desktop or a server-side app, you would store the SUPABASE\_KEY in an environment file, in the case of browser plugins, because we ship the entire thing to the client anyway, I just put it in the `supabase_client.ts`.

Let's also export the supabase client at the end of this new file:

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseUrl = 'https://orktigushjmxmztfwmpd.supabase.co'
const supabaseKey = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im9ya3RpZ3VzaGpteG16dGZ3bXBkIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE2NzAwNTA2NTksImV4cCI6MTk4NTYyNjY1OXO.4XZvJi1jWbj5GWqRHB7Jgri7jnGMFGk-vkFKgeNDU0s'

const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey)

export default supabase;
```

This key is safe to use in a browser if you have enabled Row Level Security (RLS) for your tables and configured policies. I was so confused and spent some time researching how to hide this key before figuring out that I didn't have to!

We won't be writing to the database in this tutorial so the RLS configuration won't be needed, but you can read more about it [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security).

Finally, let's install the only dependency we'll need from Supabase.

```bash
$ npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

We will use the Supabase JavaScript client to let users create accounts and log into our app.

## Other packages

To keep our components clean, we'll install formik and use it to manage our forms:

```bash
$ npm install formik
```

To have nice default inputs in a TailwindCSS-driven webpage, we'll also install `@tailwindcss/forms`:

```bash
npm i -D @tailwindcss/forms
```

You'll find the setup for these in the GitHub repo.

# Use Supabase client in the background script

As we already know from previous tutorials, the background script is the place to make API requests.

This is why we're implementing sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, and session fetching here.

Let's import the `./src/supabase_client.ts` script to our background script and handle the sign-up and sign-in messages:

```typescript
// ./background.ts
import browser from "webextension-polyfill";
import supabase from './src/supabase_client';

type Message = {
  action: 'fetch' | 'getSession' | 'signout',
  value: null
} | {
  action: 'signup' | 'signin',
  value: {
    email: string,
    password: string,
  }
}

async function handleMessage({ action, value }: Message, response: ResponseCallback) {
  //  ...
  } else if (action === 'signup') {
    const result = await supabase.auth.signUp(value)
    response({message: 'Successfully signed up!', data: result});

  } else if (action === 'signin') {
    console.log('requesting auth');
    const {data, error} = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword(value);
    response({data, error});

  }  else if (action === 'getSession') {
    supabase.auth.getSession().then(response)

  } else if (action === 'signout') {
    const {error} = await supabase.auth.signOut()
    response({data: null, error});
  }
  // ...
}
```

We're using the auth module of the supabase client that already comes with a super straightforward interface for handling the user sign-up flow, sign-in, sign-out, and session retrieval. Here are the functions we use above with links to their official docs:

*   [signUp](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup)
    
*   [signInWithPassword](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithpassword)
    
*   [getSession](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getsession)
    
*   [signOut](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout)
    

Before we dive into the user sign-up and sign-in, let's talk about how we'll handle showing different screens to the user.

# Routing in a browser plugin

In the case of a web app, when the user wants to sign in, you redirect them to the `/signin` page.

We cannot do that here because our plugin lives in the context of the web page that the user is currently looking at.

I created a diagram to show you all the possible states of our UI:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670225365854/pA8Kwthe1.png align="left")

To facilitate showing different screens based on different states we will create a state called `screen` that will indicate at which step the user is currently.

Actions like sign-up will modify the screen state and change it to `SCREEN.SIGN_IN` for example, and `renderApp` will return the appropriate component:

```typescript
enum SCREEN {
  SIGN_IN, SIGN_UP, FACTS
}

const App = () => {
  // ...
  const [screen, setScreen] = useState(SCREEN.FACTS);
  // ...
  function renderApp() {
    if (!session) {
      if (screen === SCREEN.SIGN_UP) {
        return <SignIn title='Sign Up' .../>;
      }
      return <SignIn title='Sign In' ... />
    }

    return (
      // Cat Fact screen
    )
  }

  return (
    <div className='absolute top-20 left-20'>
      <div className='flex flex-col gap-4 p-4 shadow-sm bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-100 to-blue-200 w-96 rounded-md'>
        <h1>Cat Facts!</h1>
        {renderApp()}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
```

The next step will be creating the Sign In/Sign up React component.

# User authentication

You'll find this [component code](https://github.com/akoskm/vite-react-tailwindcss-browser-extension-supabase/blob/fe773081ed0fe07aa9d9f27c08c33f5be60eadc5/content-script/SignIn.tsx) in the GitHub repo. I'll omit it here for brevity.

It's a simple React Form that captures user input and does something on `onSubmit`.

The interesting part happens in `App.tsx`.

## Check if the user is logged in

This is going to be the first time we make a request to Supabase when the App mounts:

```typescript
// App.tsx

  async function getSession() {
    const {data: {session}} = await browser.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'getSession'});
    setSession(session);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    getSession();
  }, []);
```

The above function is going to send the `{ action: 'getSession' }` message to the background script that, in exchange, is going to call the [getSession](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getsession) function of the `supabase.auth` module.

When the response arrives, we send it to the caller, our content script.

Because we'll get back either the session or null - if the session cannot be detected - we'll just set whatever we get back from the background script.

## Sign up

Let's handle sign-ups by adding this function in `App.tsx`

```typescript
  async function handleSignUp(email: string, password: string) {
    await browser.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'signup', value: {email, password}});
    setScreen(SCREEN.SIGN_IN)
  }
```

Just as in the `getSession` function, we're communicating our intent to the background script with the `{action: 'signup', value: {email, password}}` message.

Unlike the session retrieval, this time, the message also contains a `value` key that contains an object that has the email and password values we entered into the Sign-Up form.

When the Sign-Up form is submitted, we will send these values to the background script where the appropriate branch will run:

```typescript
// ...
  } else if (action === 'signup') {
    const result = await supabase.auth.signUp(value)
    response({message: 'Successfully signed up!', data: result});
// ...
```

Finally, if the Sign-Up process is successful, we'll show the user the Sign-In screen.

Let's add the Sign-Up step to our `renderApp` function and show it when we don't have an active `session` and the active screen is the Sign-Up screen:

```typescript
  function renderApp() {
    if (!session) {
      if (screen === SCREEN.SIGN_UP) {
        return <SignIn onSignIn={handleSignUp} title={'Sign Up'} onScreenChange={() => {
          setScreen(SCREEN.SIGN_IN);
          setError('');
        }} helpText={'Got an account? Sign in'} error={error}/>;
      }

      return <SignIn title='Sign In' ... />
    }

    return (
      // Cat Fact screen
    )
  }
```

A cool feature of Supabase is that it automatically sends signed-up users a confirmation email.

You can't log in without confirming your account, reducing spam and fake sign-ups.

## Sign in

The Sign-in flow is almost identical to this, with the only difference being in how we handle the response from our background script:

```typescript
async function handleSignIn(email: string, password: string) {
  const {data, error} = await browser.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'signin', value: {email, password}});
  if (error) return setError(error.message)

  setSession(data.session)
}
```

Supabase [signInWithPassword](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithpassword) can return both an `error` and a `data` object.

If there's an error, we capture it here and display it to the user.

# Demo

Now let's showcase the entire flow together.

Create an account, log in and fetch some fresh cat facts:

# Conclusion

Congratulations on creating your first Supabase Authentication flow!

And not any Supabase Authentication flow, but as a cross-browser authentication flow!

You could use this to make a browser plugin that stores per-user data or hide something considered sensitive behind a login.

After you're logged in to Supabase, your options are endless!

You could initialize a new database, as shown [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database), and start doing some CRUD:

*   [create](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/insert)
    
*   [read](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select)
    
*   [update](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/update)
    
*   [delete](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/delete)
    

on user data using the same JavaScript library you used to create and authenticate a user.

I hope you liked this tutorial!
