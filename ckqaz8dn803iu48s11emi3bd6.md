## Tutorial: Apollo Client with React and TypeScript

We love Apollo Client because of its built-in robust state management, in-memory caching, and error handling capabilities.
To keep the demo simple we’re not going to write any backend code for this presentation, and use the publicly available [SpaceX GraphQL API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/).

# Installing Apollo Client with React and TypeScript

To make our lives simpler we’re also going to start with `create-react-app`, specifically with a typescript template:

```
yarn create react-app apollo-client-react-typescript --template typescript
```

Next, we’re going to install the Apollo Client alongside GraphQL:

```
yarn add @apollo/client graphql
```

The `@apollo/client` package contains the state management/caching and error handling while `graphql` parses the GraphQL queries.

Now that we have these packages installed we’ll create the building blocks that are necessary to communicate with the GraphQL endpoint.

# Data fetching with Apollo Client

## Building a client

The Apollo Client is the object where we specify the details of our connection.

To create an [`ApolloClient`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/) we must set the following parameters in the constructor:

 - `uri`: GraphQL URL we want to query when using `ApolloClient`
 - `cache`: a cache configuration to tell Apollo Client how to store the results on your machine

Our Apollo Client will look like this:

```js
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.spacex.land/graphql/',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

## Building an Apollo Provider

To be able to use this Apollo Client instance inside a React Component, we have to wrap the React component with a specific component called [`ApolloProvider`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#the-apolloprovider-component).
This accepts a single prop: `client` that is an instance of an `ApolloClient`.

## Connecting the Apollo Provider to the React Component

It's time to pass our instance of ApolloClient to the `ApolloProvider` component.

The best place to do this is a top-level component (such as `index.tsx` in our app) so all child components will have access to the Apollo client through the same provider.
Open `index.tsx`, our top-level component and wrap it with `ApolloProvider` while passing in the `ApolloClient` instance:

```js
import App from './App';
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client/react';
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://api.spacex.land/graphql/',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <App />
    </ApolloProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Querying data with Apollo Client and TypeScript

Now that we wrapped the `App` React Component with `ApolloProvider`, we’re ready to make some queries.
GraphQL, thanks to its GraphiQL interface provides an easy way to discover GraphQL APIs.

If you haven’t decided what you want to query for, visit the interactive explorer of the SpaceX API here: [https://api.spacex.land/graphql/](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/).

Let’s say we want to create a query that returns the id, name, the Wikipedia link, and a brief description of each SpaceX rocket.

_If you're new to the GraphQL syntax I suggest you visit [https://graphql.org/learn/queries/](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)._

The query would look like this:

```graphql
{
  rockets {
    id
    name
    wikipedia
    description
  }
}
```

Let’s create a type that describes a single rocket:

```ts
interface RocketData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  wikipedia: string;
  description: string;
}
```

Don’t forget, we’re going to receive an array of rockets here, so let’s create a type for that as well:

```typescript
interface RocketsResult {
  rockets: Array<RocketData>;
}
```

To run this query we’re going to use the [`useQuery`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#usequery) hook and the `gql` function, provided by the Apollo Client:

```typescript
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const ROCKETS = gql`
  rockets {
    id
    name
    wikipedia
    description
  }
`;

function App() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery<RocketsResult>(ROCKETS);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>SpaceX Rockets</h1>
      {loading || !data ? (<p>Loading...</p>) :
        data.rockets.map(rocket => (
          <div key={rocket.id}>
            <h2><a href={rocket.wikipedia}>{rocket.name}</a></h2>
            <p>{rocket.description}</p>
          </div>
        ))
      }
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

`useQuery`’s first type is the type that corresponds to the data structure we’re going to receive from the GraphQL endpoint.

The `useQuery` hook also returns an object with the following properties:

 - `loading`: indicates if Apollo Client is still waiting for the query results
 - `error`: if the query resulted in error(s)
 - `data`: the results of the GraphQL Query

Now you can run the app with `yarn start` and you should see something similar in your browser:

# Modifying data with Apollo Client

Now that we’ve learned how to fetch data with Apollo Client it would be nice to see how we can update things at the other end of the GraphQL endpoint.

SpaceX API provides a simple interface for adding users.

When writing a mutation query we use the same `gql` function we used for the query:

```typescript
const ADD_USER = gql`
  mutation InsertUser($name: String!) {
    insert_users(objects: { name: $name }) {
      returning {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

You might’ve already noticed that, unlike the query, the mutation has a function-like signature. In case of `insert_user` it accepts `objects: { name: $name }`.

Let’s define some TypeScript types to describe what kind of data we’re getting back from this mutation. These types are going to depend a lot on how the GraphQL endpoint formats its response. In our case, the types are the following:

```typescript
interface UserDetails {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

interface AddUserResponse {
  returning: Array<UserDetails>;
}
```

The [`useMutation`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/#usemutation) query has the following signature:

```typescript
  const [addUser, { data: userData }] = useMutation<
    { insert_users: AddUserResponse }
  >(ADD_USER);
```

Important to note that the mutation is not called when we define the hook.
It returns a function - in our case `addUser` - that we should call with the necessary parameters.
Same as for the `userQuery` hooks, the type you pass into `useMutation` should match the response you get back from the server after you call this mutation.

Now let’s put it all together:

```typescript
interface UserDetails {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
}

interface AddUserResponse {
  returning: Array<UserDetails>;
}

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const [addUser, { data: userData }] = useMutation<
    { insert_users: AddUserResponse }
  >(ADD_USER);

  function handleOnChange(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setName(e.target.value);
  }

  async function handleOnSubmit(e: React.FormEvent) {
    e.preventDefault();
    await addUser({ variables: { name }});
    setName('');
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleOnSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="username">Name: </label>
        <input required name="username" type="text" onChange={handleOnChange} value={name}/>
        <button type="submit">Add User</button>
        <p>
          New User ID: {userData && userData.insert_users.returning[0].id}
        </p>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

Here’s what you should see in your browser:

Congratulation, you just added a new user to SpaceX API’s Database!

Are you already using GraphQL in some of your projects? Do you think it's going to replace REST?
